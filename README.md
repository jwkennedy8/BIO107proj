# Introduction to William Smith

William Smith was an English Geologist who was known for creating a geologic map of England. He was able to construct a map by leveraging his knowledge of patterns in rock layers from his time working on canals. Most significantly, he was the first geologist to use fossils to determine ages of rock layers (UC Museum of Paleontology, 1996). His contributions were later used and expanded upon by Charles Darwin and Charles Lyell in the fields of evolutionary biology and geology respectively.

# Smith's contributions

Smith came from a relatively poor small family of farmers so he initially did not have the education or resources to create a complete geologic map of England. When he eventually did publish his map in 1815, he had as many as 400 people supporting him financially as travelling and conducting research across England was such a large project. His beginnings in the field of geology came from being a surveyors assistant starting from the age of 18. Then in the 1790’s he worked for a canal company in Bath, England. As part of his work for the company, he travelled to observe other work done on canals across the country. His observations of rock stratification of the canals as well as patterns of fossils in the layers enabled him to start work on documenting rock layers to create a geologic map of Bath and the surrounding area. The document he wrote was called “table of strata in the vicinity of Bath” which was considered to be groundbreaking in the field of geology,  “...it was for this that William Smith became known as one of the principal founders of the Science of Geology” (Pickford, 1969). Smith later gifted this document to the Geological Society of London where it was displayed until the 1980’s. 


# Key Index Fossils

Smith's technique of using fossils to date rock layers is still relevant today and it is known as the principle of faunal succession. In practice, Geologists use fossils from organisms that are known to have existed at a specific period of time which tells them about the rock layer in which they formed. These are called Key Index Fossils or just Index Fossils. These fossils are characterized by only forming in a short period of time relative to the geologic timescale. Ideally, Index Fossils are widespread and also abundant which would make finding the fossil easier and also enable more rock layers to be dated around the world. For example, fossils from Trilobites are popular index fossils because they evolved very quickly and existed between 521 to 252 million years ago (Geologyin, 2024). Although it is a long period of time, on a geological timescale having many fossils that are exclusively from this time period is useful since their existence almost perfectly lines up with the Paleozoic era.

# Influence on Darwin

Although William Smith passed away 20 years before Darwin published On the Origin of Species, his work helped support the theory of evolution. Darwin does not explicitly mention Smith, but argues that the succession of fossils supports his idea that organisms change over time, “Let us now see whether the several facts and laws relating to the geological succession of organic beings accord best with the common view of the immutability of species, or with that of their slow and gradual modification, through variation and natural selection.” (Darwin, 1859).  Here, Darwin is using the principle of faunal succession to explain why species are changing over time. Since there is a consistent pattern in the order fossils appear by layer depth, it shows that species have changed over time. Darwin is using the assumption that older layers are beneath younger layers and explaining the predictability of the fossil record as a result of evolutionary changes to organisms. Darwin implies that a perfect, complete geological fossil record would reveal each stage of evolution due to the sequence of fossils in rock layers, “He who rejects this view of the imperfection of the geological record, will rightly reject the whole theory. For he may ask in vain where are the numberless transitional links which must formerly have connected the closely allied or representative species, found in the successive stages of the same great formation?” (Darwin, 1859). However, he correctly deduces that the fossil record cannot be complete due to fossils being destroyed or undiscovered.

# Influence on Lyell

In addition to his influence on evolutionary biology, William Smith's contributions laid the groundwork for Charles Lyell. Like Darwin, Lyell’s major scientific contributions came a few decades after Smith's work in the early 1800s. He wrote The Principles of Geology which introduced his theory of uniformitarianism. His theory provided mechanistic explanations for rock stratification and the fossil record. He theorized the same mechanisms seen today are also the cause of the geology of the earth throughout history. In The Principles of Geology, Lyell writes about the usefulness of index fossils,  “The fossils which characterize the different formations, play a very important part in the identification of strata; and although the order of superposition is the primary test, yet where that order is indistinct, or disturbed, the fossil contents become the best guides.” Here, Lyell is recognizing how Smith’s method of using fossils to relatively date strata is very practical.

# Conclusion

William Smith’s work in the context of the contributions of Lyell and Darwin is exceptionally significant considering the fact that the theory of evolution and uniformitarianism are generally accepted and important theories in the scientific community. Not only were Smith’s contributions helpful, but they were timely as Darwin and Lyell published their notable works between 1830-1860 which is only 15-45 years after Smith had completed his geological map of England.
